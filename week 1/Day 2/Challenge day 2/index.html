        <p>
            Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a billionaire industrialist,<br> a founding member of the Avengers,
            and the former CEO of Stark Industries.<br> A brash but brilliant inventor,
            Stark was self-described as a genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist.<br>
            With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge,<br>
            Stark was one of the world's most powerful men following the deaths of his parents and enjoyed the playboy
            lifestyle for many years<br> until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan,
            while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles.<br> With his life on the line,
            Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape his captors.<br> Upon returning home,
            he utilized several more armors to use against terrorists, as well as Obadiah Stane who turned against
            Stark.<br>
            Stark enjoyed the fame that came with his new secret identity and decided to share it with the world,<br>
            publicly revealing himself as Iron Man.
